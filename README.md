# Animal Sounds App
I have made this app on Android Studio using Java.
The app is built to listen the various sounds of different types of animals. The app have a nice design with the best colour combination. It has an eye attracking user interface which make it more enjoyable to use it. The app have sounds of different types of categories of animals which are categorized according to their types in each part. The app works faster and accurate for listening the sounds and efficient to use. The app is error free and tested well so it will not hang or create an issue. Hope you like it ;-)
